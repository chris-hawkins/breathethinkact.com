				<h1>A Simple Business Strategy. Breathe. Think. Act.</h1>
					<h2>The idea is a simple one</h2>
						<p>Based in one of the core skills in diving: when faced with a problem, 
							just Stop. Breathe. Think. Breathe. Act.</p>
						<p>Small business owners have enough to do just to keep their heads above water. 
							BTA provides a partnership to determine your needs and then 
							assists in the implementation of the solution. Simple as that.</p>
						<img src="images/breathethinkact-ref.gif" style="float:right" alt="practice what we teach" />
					<h2>Breathe.</h2>
						<p>Breathing is easy. Running a business...not so much. Finding the solution 
						 to any problem requires taking a step back and just breathing. What 
						 I provide is an outside perspective and the fundamentals to getting you back on track.</p>
					<h2>Think.</h2>
						<p>Rarely do things run as smoothly as imagined. I encourage and 
						guide my clients to be proactive instead of reactive. The solution, generally, 
						will present itself. I am here to ensure you find it.</p>
					<h2>Act.</h2>
						<p>Implementing a solution is easier said than done. The logistics can be 
						overwhelming and when push comes to shove, not everyone has the ability to see
						the bigger picture...especially when you are too close to the situation. I have experience in providing the
						perspective that can get you to step back and see the big picture, so that you can accomplish what needs to be done.</p>
						<h3>Breathe. Think. Act. Simple as that.</h3>
					<h2>The Label:</h2>
						<img src="images/peeps.gif" style="float:right" alt="the right people" />
						<p>I don't like labels, they're limiting. What I do like is improving performance, primarily through 
						the analysis of existing business problems and developing a plan for improvement. My understanding of how 
						to get the most out of simple solutions is based on past experiences and relationships with numerous 
						organizations. I am particularly effective and efficient with: operational and strategic improvement, 
						asset management (better known as employees), change management, identification of problems and implementation of solutions.
						Call me what you will but in this case, I think actions and results are more accurate than a label.</p>
					<h2>The short version:</h2>
						<p>I solve problems.</p>
					<h2 style="margin-top:30px;">Who I Work With:</h2>
						<p>BTA focuses on assisting businesses that do not consider themselves to be part of Corporate America.</p>
					<h2>The direct version:</h2>
						<p>If you're into convention, bureaucracy and office politics, BTA isn't for you.</p>
					<h2 style="margin-top:30px;">How I Get Things Done:</h2>
						<p>I use a combination of a prescriptive and facilitative approach. The prescriptive approach 
						provides the expertise to solve a problem; the facilitative approach 
						advises and guides so that the problem can be identified.</p>
					<h2>What this really means:</h2>
						<p>When the problem is clear, then I will come in and help you fix it.  When the issue isn't clear, I will diagnose it.</p>
					<h2 style="margin-top:30px;">Advantages to Working With BTA:</h2>
						<ul>
							<li>I ensure success is in alignment with strategic and tactical objectives</li>
							<li>Quick ramp up time and resolution, to mitigate extraneous costs without sacrificing quality</li>
							<li>Objectivity and an unbiased perspective</li>
							<li>Tailored strategies that fit individual client needs</li>
							<li>Follow-up on project results</li></ul>
